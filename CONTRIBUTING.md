## Pull Request Process
The process for submitting a Pull Request (PR) is straightforward:
- <b>Feature</b>

    Create an issue to explain your proposed feature, then submit a PR.

- <b>Bug</b>

    Create an issue detailing the problem as clearly as possible, then submit a PR.

- <b>TODO</b>

    You can address TODO comments in the code without needing to create an issue; simply submit the PR.
